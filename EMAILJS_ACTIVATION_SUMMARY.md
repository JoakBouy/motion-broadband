# EmailJS Activation Summary

## Overview
Successfully switched the contact form to use EmailJS as the primary email delivery method, with mailto as a fallback only when EmailJS fails.

## üîÑ **Changes Made**

### **Primary Method: EmailJS**
- **Removed Configuration Check**: No longer checks if EmailJS credentials exist
- **Direct EmailJS Usage**: Attempts to send via EmailJS immediately
- **Success Logging**: Console log confirms successful EmailJS delivery
- **Professional Delivery**: Emails sent directly to `sales@motionbroadbandltd.com`

### **Fallback Method: Mailto (Error Only)**
- **Triggered Only on EmailJS Failure**: Mailto only activates if EmailJS fails
- **Seamless Transition**: User still sees success message even with fallback
- **Error Handling**: Only shows error if both methods fail
- **User Experience**: Maintains smooth form experience

## üìß **Current Email Flow**

### **Step 1: EmailJS Attempt**
1. User submits contact form
2. Form validates required fields
3. EmailJS sends email directly to `sales@motionbroadbandltd.com`
4. Success: Shows confirmation message and resets form
5. Console logs: "Email sent successfully via EmailJS"

### **Step 2: Fallback (If EmailJS Fails)**
1. EmailJS encounters error (network, service, etc.)
2. System automatically tries mailto fallback
3. Opens user's default email client with pre-filled message
4. Success: Shows confirmation message and resets form
5. Console logs: "EmailJS sending failed" + error details

### **Step 3: Complete Failure (Rare)**
1. Both EmailJS and mailto fail
2. Shows error message with direct contact information
3. Provides "Try Again" button
4. Console logs: Both error messages
