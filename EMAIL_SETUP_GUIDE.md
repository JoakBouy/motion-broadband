# Email Setup Guide for Motion Broadband Contact Form

## Overview
The contact form has been configured to send emails to `sales@motionbroadbandltd.com` using EmailJS service. If EmailJS is not configured, it falls back to opening the user's default email client with a pre-filled message.

## üöÄ **Quick Start (Fallback Method)**
The contact form will work immediately using the mailto fallback method:
- When users submit the form, their default email client opens
- The email is pre-filled with all form data
- Users can send the email directly from their email client
- This works without any additional setup

## üìß **EmailJS Setup (Recommended)**
For a more professional experience, set up EmailJS to send emails directly from the website:

### **Step 1: Create EmailJS Account**
1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### **Step 2: Create Email Service**
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions for your provider
5. Note down your **Service ID**

### **Step 3: Create Email Template**
1. Go to "Email Templates" in EmailJS dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template content:

```html
Subject: New Contact Form Submission - {{subject}}

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Phone: {{phone}}

Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from the Motion Broadband website contact form.
```

4. Set the template variables:
   - `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
   - `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email
   - `{{phone}}` - Sender's phone
   - `{{subject}}` - Message subject
   - `{{message}}` - Message content

5. Set the "To Email" to: `sales@motionbroadbandltd.com`
6. Note down your **Template ID**

### **Step 4: Get Public Key**
1. Go to "Account" in EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** (also called User ID)
3. Note it down

### **Step 5: Configure Environment Variables**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in your project root
2. Fill in your EmailJS credentials:

```env
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```
